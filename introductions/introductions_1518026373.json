I was the first business analyst in our company so we were learning as we went and didn't have much structure. I might be able to help with writing stories and basic project management stuff. I have aspirations and dreams to be a dev but can help immediately with other stuff. I have experience using Jira and trello. We used Jira professionally and I have used Trello in my personal life. Looking forward to being part of something like this!",

I would like to change my current job into something blockchain related, so I try to educate myself as much as I can in my freetime. Most of the time when I learn something new I just start a project.

Well, that's if you don't count having my dad purchase me \"HTML for Dummies, first edition\", back in '95 or '96.\n\nSince (before) then I have always had a passion for technology. My programming efforts led me into internet marketing where I used my skills to create tools for internal use, giving me an advantage against competitors (e.g. on Google Adwords). I did a lot of automation, keyword harvesting, and big data analysis \/ prediction.\n\nThe money was in advertising, so that is why I applied my technology skills there. But that was never my passion. Now with Blockchain, I see an opportunity to make a new career, for myself and thousands of others, out of community collaboration.\n\nI have stopped actively focusing on my advertising business (it still runs okay without me) and started focusing full time on Blockchain development. I'm completely obsessed with reading programming books like I used to do when I was a kid.\n\nPlaying a bit of catch up on truly mastering the newest of technologies (e.g. Functional Programming), but I have never stopped coding during all these years.\n\nI can't wait to tackle new challenges of learning new languages, frameworks, paradigms, APIs, whatever... and build some awesome stuff in the process with all of you.\n\nNow your turn.
