<h1>U946G1GLS</h1>
<p>Hi everyone! Quick summary about me:
- being involved in web development for the past 8 years: Ruby on Rails, node.js, react, ember, …
- taught introduction to web development for 4 years to a local university, and was also part in the creation of a student startup pre-incubator, helping students shape their business ideas into projects in order to be accepted to bigger incubators / receive funding
- started myself a couple of projects
- been in crypto since the beginning of last year, learned solidity and started playing with contracts since then 
-&gt; now I’m fascinated about the possibilities the blockchain technologies can bring to the world so I’m hoping here we could create prosper together a community of great projects.</p>

<h1>U93BJC0F2</h1>
<p>Hey guys. I’m a full stack web developer for work. I have developed APIs in Python and Node and have experience building web apps with Angular and React/Redux. I am very interested in the future of blockchain technologies so I began teaching myself Solidity and figuring out the whole Ethereum ecosystem. Psyched to see whatever this group turns into</p>

<h1>U94HLJEP7</h1>
<p>Hey gang. Background in building products, been coding since I was 15 (HTML/CSS) — the good old days of Geocities and `&lt;marquee&gt;` tags if anyone remembers them! More recently it’s been with Golang, Swift (iOS), React JS, Mobx, Web3, Solidity and the AWS stack (EC2, RDS, ElastiCache - Redis, Kinesis). Also do a bit of UI design (Sketch) - which can often lead to some strange context switches, 1 minute you’re in the depths of *nix debugging a deployment issue and then you’re laying out squares on a canvas… but I enjoy all aspects of building products and happy to fit in wherever I can lend a hand.</p>

<h1>U94864R5J</h1>
<p>Hi everyone! Lots of talent in here. I’m an interaction designer (UI/UX) and work at The University of Toronto full time. I also teach interaction design and development at Sheridan College. I spend most of my time on design and prototyping and everything that comes with it but also do a lot of front end dev work (js, css, HTML), php and similar. I’m focusing on react lately. 

I first heard of Ethereum when I went to a meetup in Toronto in 2014 where Vitalik and a few others talked about this new project they were launching called Ethereum. It was the right place, right time to get into crypto and have been into holding Eth since the presale. Doge however was my first crypto : ) 

I’m looking to get into on the design and ux side of things on dapps. I also have a background of shooting photos and video professionally for design and marketing agencies but now focus on all things web and blockchain.</p>

<h1>U947MNU2X</h1>
<p>Oh hai there! Super quick facts about me:
- Msc. In Innovation and Entrepreneurship
- Started Amiroh (<http://www.amiroh.com|www.amiroh.com>) right out of college
- Now doing cross-platform app development and backend on MEAN, management and marketing. 
- Got into crypto around December. Fell in love with etheruem and blockchain technology. Currently learning Solidity in my free time.

I don't have too much free time these days, but I can tell all of it will be going to this and my Solidity courses! </p>

<h1>U93AQ02CQ</h1>
<p>Hi Folks! 
I got my Bachelor’s in Graphic Design from New Zealand. Moved to the US, designed professionally for a few years after which I got into front end development (yep those jQuery days), quickly grew into the frontend more and got into more frameworks Angular, Backbone etc. Worked at companies such as Adobe as well as more corporate banks and then startups. Now I’m the front end engineering manager and do a lot of React, Redux at my current role in a fast growing startup (if I can call it that at this point) and run a team of 7 front end engineers. I’m very interested in block chain tech and looking to get my hands dirty into some development. Interested specifically in Ether and Stellar networks for now. Would love to get some cool app going.</p>

<p>Hello! I'm currently a Java developer working in a networking, message brokering type of system with multiple entry points and simultaneous communication. Prior to this I've worked with some low level embedded networking (C), and prior to that I worked with some full stack web development (C#, javascript, html, css). Actually using javascript/jquery a bit in my current project as well. I've been invested in crypto for about 3 years now, primarily on the investing/trading end of it, but as of last year I started to get more informed on the technicalities of blockchain technologies. I've been meaning to get more involved so here I am!</p>

<p>I'm sure that experience will come in handy. There's so much to cloud infrastructure, it's hard to master it all in your spare time.

I'm moderately proficient with a handful of AWS tools, but no where near all of them.

Have also dabbled in some of Azure's cloud services, which are pretty awesome too (e.g. used their Translation API for a Python app I wrote).

Glad to have you in the group!</p>

<h1>U943QV6BV</h1>
<p>Hi all. I posted in the Reddit thread as bob_newhart. I was a business analyst in a past life. I was the first business analyst in our company so we were learning as we went and didn't have much structure. I might be able to help with writing stories and basic project management stuff. I have aspirations and dreams to be a dev but can help immediately with other stuff. I have experience using Jira and trello. We used Jira professionally and I have used Trello in my personal life. Looking forward to being part of something like this!</p>

I love the concept that value no longer needs to be tied  to corporate profits. In the past, that was the only way we could measure value.

Now, all "value" added to any sub-ecosystem can be rewarded fairly.</p>

<p>Hi, Im a computer scientist from germany specalized in software technology and language design, i worki for 10 years in a company where I many focus on frontend development, software architecture and implenting it serverside. I hack in alot of programming languages, mostly for my own needs. Sometimes I feel like it might intersset someone else and i cleanup my code and put it on github :wink: i'm very new in the crypto world and try to learn as much as I can (mostly in the monero space). I would like to change my current job into something blockchain related, so I try to educate myself as much as I can in my freetime. Most of the time when I learn something new I just start a project. At the moment it is very hard for a open source developer to just do something blockchain related (because of lack of creativity :D), so i'm looking forward to maybe create something useful :+1:</p>

<h1>U93CZR0LR</h1>
<p>Hey everyone! A bit about myself:

I've been into programming since ~1999 when I purchased a C++ book as my gateway. Well, that's if you don't count having my dad purchase me "HTML for Dummies, first edition", back in '95 or '96.

Since (before) then I have always had a passion for technology. My programming efforts led me into internet marketing where I used my skills to create tools for internal use, giving me an advantage against competitors (e.g. on Google Adwords). I did a lot of automation, keyword harvesting, and big data analysis / prediction.

The money was in advertising, so that is why I applied my technology skills there. But that was never my passion. Now with Blockchain, I see an opportunity to make a new career, for myself and thousands of others, out of community collaboration.

I have stopped actively focusing on my advertising business (it still runs okay without me) and started focusing full time on Blockchain development. I'm completely obsessed with reading programming books like I used to do when I was a kid.

Playing a bit of catch up on truly mastering the newest of technologies (e.g. Functional Programming), but I have never stopped coding during all these years.

I can't wait to tackle new challenges of learning new languages, frameworks, paradigms, APIs, whatever... and build some awesome stuff in the process with all of you.

Now your turn. Let's hear a little but about you!</p>
